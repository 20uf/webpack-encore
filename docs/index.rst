Webpack Encore
==============

`Webpack Encore`_ is a simpler way to integrate `Webpack`_ into your
application. It *wraps* Webpack, giving you a clean & powerful API
for bundling JavaScript modules, pre-processing CSS & JS and compiling
and minifying assets. Encore gives you professional asset system
that's a *delight* to use.

Encore is inspired by `Webpacker`_ and `Mix`_, but stays in the spirit of
Webpack: using its features, concepts and naming conventions for a familiar
feel. It aims to solve the most common Webpack use cases.

.. tip::

    Encore is made by `Symfony`_ and works *beautifully* in Symfony applications.
    But it can easily be used in any application... in any language!
